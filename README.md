I referenced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3OIOr9dJI.
It is simple Google Login + Post and Comments CRUD projects.
(Using React + Typescript + Google oauth(Login & Logout) + Mysql)

1) If you're not logged in,
you can read posts and comments. 

2) If you're logged in,
you can read and write posts and comments.

3) If this is a post&comment you wrote,
(compare with google email)
you can update or delete the post & comment
